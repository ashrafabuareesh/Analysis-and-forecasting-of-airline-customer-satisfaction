 ## Project Introduction
* An airline company is keen on understanding their customers better to enhance their overall satisfaction. In pursuit of this goal, the company has gathered comprehensive information about 20,000 customers. This dataset includes detailed responses from a 
 satisfaction survey. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover key insights into customer preferences, identify areas of improvement, and ultimately help the airline tailor its services to meet customer expectations more effectively.

# Model Selection Report for Predicting Customer Satisfaction
* An airline company is keen on understanding their customers better to enhance their overall satisfaction. As part of this project, we developed three different models to predict customer satisfaction based on the data from a satisfaction survey of 20,000 customers. This report evaluates the performance of these models and selects the best one for predicting customer satisfaction.

## Models Evaluated : 

   - Logistic Regression Model
   - Deep Learning Model (Keras)

## Model Evaluation Metrics : 

* The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

  * Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model.

  * Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive cases in the data.

  * F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

  * Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions.
 
## Logistic Regression Model Performance: 
* The classification metrics for the logistic regression model on the test data are as follows:

## Final Decision: 
* Based on the performance metrics, the Deep Learning Model outperforms the logistic regression model in all evaluated metrics. With higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, the deep learning model is the best choice for predicting customer satisfaction.
# Conclusion: 
* By selecting the deep learning model, the airline company can gain more accurate and reliable insights into customer satisfaction drivers. This model will help the company to implement targeted strategies to improve services and enhance customer loyalty, ultimately leading to higher overall customer satisfaction.
